# READ FOR THE PURPORSE OF THIS PROJECT
Getting familiar with the Pandas Library. In this short project, I follow along Keith Gallis' Pandas Python video to familiarize myself with Pandas after a break with Python. This also includes my own mini-project at the end where I use a simple for loop to find the mean of each numeric column by Pokemon type, regardless of their first/second type.
